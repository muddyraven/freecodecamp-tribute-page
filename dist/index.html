      <h3>Oogy's Story</h3>
      <p>In 2002, when Oogy was about ten weeks old he was tied to a stake and used as bait for a fighting dog at a drug house. The left side of his face and most of his ear was torn off, and his lower jaw was crushed. He was then thrown into a cage and left to bleed to death. He was found by police when they raided the facility, and taken to Ardmore Animal Hospital in Philadelphia. He was operated on for several hours, and somehow with the help of all the staff involved, he survived.</p>
      <p>Diane Klien, Director of Operations for the hospital, took Oogy home for several weeks to ensure he was safe with children and to train him whist he made his recovery. It was assumed that Oogy was an American Pit Bull Terrier, and some people refused to let their children near him despite his amazing temperament.  But Oogy grew fast, and was later discovered to be a Dogo Argentino. Dogos were bred to hunt mountain lion and boar in their native country of Argentina, and can weigh up to 50kg. They hunt in packs and can run great distances, but are also loving and loyal family pets.</p>
      <p>Oogy was adopted by the Levin family, who quickly became bully breed advocates, and his story quickly went viral. Oogy became a celebrity in 2008 when he guest starred on Oprah, and went on to become the subject of a bestselling book in 2010. He also had to endure several more operations, amongst them one to rebuild his face, and another to battle a pervasive infection in his skull caused by his original injuries</p>
      <p>Through all of this Oogy made trips to schools where his story would be told to help non-profit and rescue charities, and to prisons where he helped volunteers to teach inmates about dogs and train them so that they would be more adoptable. Oogy travelled to communities where dog fighting was endemic in order to raise awarness and influence change in street-level dog fighting. He also made many public appearances. </p>
      <p>Oogy spent twelve wonderful years with his loving family before he died of old age, but hopefully his story will continue to help animals in need.
